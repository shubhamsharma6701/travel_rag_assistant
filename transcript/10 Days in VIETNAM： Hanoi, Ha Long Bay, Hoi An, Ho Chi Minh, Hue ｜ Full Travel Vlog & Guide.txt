 Vietnam and what a country it is. Earlier last year, we spent 10 unforgettable days in this beautiful part of the world. 10 days of mouth-watering cuisine, epic countryside, a town full of lanterns, historic tombs of past emperors, custom fitted dresses and beaches. In this video we'll be taking you through our time here, along with places we would recommend, trips that are worth checking out and how to make sure you return in one piece. If you're new here, then welcome. We make travel movies from around the world, hoping you might just find your next holiday inspiration. This is Suitcase Monkey spending 10 full days in Vietnam.  We arrived early into Hanoi. Its location provides the perfect starting point to travel the country north to south. Hanoi is Vietnam's capital and second largest city, where we would be spending our first two days. Still suffering from jet lag, we stuffed our mouths with pho, then started to explore its buzzing streets. Thank you.  Right in the middle of the city is this Notre-Dame inspired church. St Joseph's Cathedral was one of the first structures built by the French, and is a reminder of the hostile takeover in the 1850s. This would be the first of many time capsules we'd see on our trip. We actually returned to this spot for our second evening, which allowed us to sample some of Hanoi's famous coffee culture scene. Hanoi certainly lends itself to a walking city, that is, if you can avoid being run over by a million motorbikes, or in one instance, a train. This Instagram wonder sees homes, bars and cafes, all packed along either side of a single train track. Even though this street has become a little cliché to visit, it's a really unique experience, friendly service from our mother and daughter hosts were both attentive and fun the  The trains only run a handful of times each day, so do consult a timetable if you want to see a train pass through here first hand. As night settled into the city we mostly stayed around the old quarter and enjoyed our first of many Vietnamese massages. it was this street that we returned to on both nights, not just for its vibrancy,  but the sheer quantity of great smelling street food restaurants. On our first night we rediscovered the magic of sitting in a chair made for a six-year-old and on our second night, five doors down, we loved this mini barbecue right on our table. By this point we relaxed well into Vietnam's city life. Beer, coffee, massages and feasts. So we thought it was about time to also relax into its nature. Thank you.   Hanoi is Halong Bay. Spread over 600 square miles, this massive area forms a fabulous seascape of limestone pillars pushing out of the waters. Mostly uninhabited, these 1600 islands and islets, as they're known, can be traced back 500 million years and are themselves the main attraction. So, of course, what follows is the very human thing to do and name these rocks after their obvious appearance. So be on the lookout for the Fighting Cox, the Frog, and of course, the Chopstick. The most popular way to enjoy Halong Bay is to spend a night here on one of its many boats. For the most part, they all offer a similar experience, but the crew we had were really welcoming. For the next 24 hours, we were looked after incredibly well, with all food included. The boat itself was rather grand in  scale while still feeling intimate, but it was the view from our room that was the most peaceful. Well, peaceful until it was time to disembark. The next morning, the early wake-up mentor.  only one thing, a group Tai Chi class to limber us all up as our boat moved towards its final destination. Although Ha Long Bay is mostly uninhabited, four fishing villages make up the majority of its total population. For generations, around 1600 people called this part of Vietnam home, with signs of humans doing so dating back 18,000 years. Living off the land and water, the inhabitants built schools, shops, homes and apparently even its own police force, creating a beautifully self-contained society. In recent years, due to a government directive, most inhabitants of these villages have been move to the mainland, citing better education for the young and environmental protection for this UNESCO World Heritage Site. Still, the fishing villages here  are very real, with tourism now being their main source of income. But travelling through this floating community is a breathtaking experience. Once on land, we drove back to Hanoi airport, where we took a brief one hour domestic flight to Hoi An. Now, in a move that's very unlike me, I'd done next to no research for this part of the trip, so upon checking in, we had no idea what was waiting for us just around the corner. After a spot of unpacking, we wandered into central Hoi An and were blown away with what we saw. Over the next three nights, this would become my favourite place in all of our time here and somewhere you should definitely be adding to your list. Once an important trading route  for Chinese and Japanese merchants, Hoi An is fed by the Tu Boon River. Despite its old town bursting with restaurants, markets and street food, it still feels surprisingly laid-back, thanks in part to its partial ban on motorbikes. But despite its growing popularity, it still maintains some of its authenticity and traditions. Influenced by those 16th century Japanese traders, colored lanterns would be placed outside homes in exchange for good luck. This has now become the calling card for Hoi An, where glowing lanterns and flickering candles are placed on the river, with a wish of happiness, luck and love.  Situated along the busy trading route, it's no surprise that Hoi An built an industry around silks, suits and dresses. A staggering 400 tailors fit into this tiny town, each offering a personalized outfit, unique to your design choices and style. And that's how we found ourselves on Chang Hun Dao, the street for a one of a kind outfit. The process was pretty simple. First, choose styles you like from literally thousands of photos. Maybe you like the waist of this, the length of that, the neckline of the other. all of that together and you have your complete design. Now as I'm sure you can  imagine this was all incredibly exciting for your narrator. Second, choose your cloth. This is where we were leveled up and whisked away to the fabrics room where there is obviously lots to talk about. And it was at this point that I questioned all decisions that had led me to this moment. Fabrics, fabrics, fabrics, fabrics. Although brief, I did for a second question that maybe, Just maybe I myself wasn't bringing my full sexy A-game. But that was, of course, just a fleeting moment. It was as quick as the next morning, where Chiaki returned for a final fitting, and then we picked it up, all finished, a day later. Probably the most iconic landmark in Hoi An is the Japanese Bridge. Indeed, if you ever look at the back of a 20,000 dong note,  you'll see it for yourself. Built in the 15th century, it was constructed by those same Japanese merchants who settled here, seeking quick access to the Chinese communities across the water. The bridge represents Namazu, a giant underground catfish which was said to cause earthquakes, and was therefore tied down at both ends. Unable to move, Namazu could no longer cause the ground beneath it to shake. After some more aimless meandering, we wandered into this cafe and it was time to taste another Vietnamese staple. The egg coffee or cafe chung is a bitter coffee, blended with the sweetness of egg yolk, condensed milk and sugar. necessity.  came about with milk being in short supply during the French colonization. And you can still actually visit the place where the original egg coffee was invented, in Hanoi. Let's just say that we filmed this a few times, and this was the most positive reaction I had. It's a really bitter coffee, albeit with a creamy, dense layer on top. But I'm just a low-life, single-shot latte guy, so what do I know? Music Another walk and more signature dishes, this time with great success.  The Khao Lo is Hoi An's definitive dish, and is only available here since it's cooked with water from local wells. With barbecued pork slices sitting in fat udon-type noodles, greens, and a pork-based gravy, this really hit the spot. We also tried a dish known as White Rose, named to reflect the appearance of its pork wrapped up in light, flattened dumplings. both essential dishes to taste. For dinner I have to highlight this restaurant here, since it was my absolute favourite in all of Vietnam. These pork steam buns were incredible, with a delightful lingering aftertaste. I also ordered the banh mi, which translates primarily to baked goods, so often referring to a sandwich or baguette. The plate did have bread, but it was more of a side dish to this succulent juicy chicken dripping in sauce. If you're ever in Hoi An I would 100% recommend you check this place out, especially when this epic three  course meal came to a total of £15. Our last day in Hoi An was a relaxed one. Renting bikes from our hotel, we took a 30 minute cycle to the local beach and lounged around with some cocktails. Later that evening, we thought we'd end our time in Hoi An, returning to the place where we first fell for it. Albeit this time, we travelled the same path as they would have done 500 years ago.  3 hours north of Hoi An, lies the important city of Hue, Vietnam's old imperial capital. Since the 1800s, it's had an illustrious history, primarily for being the home to the last of its emperors. Now the city is a lively one, with a busy nightlife, restaurants and cafes, but all sitting comfortable amongst its historical roots, which have not been forgotten. These roots are on no better display than the Imperial City. This whole citadel, complete with its vast landscape,  palace grounds and gateways took 27 years to complete and is one of the largest architectural complexes in all of Vietnam. On approach the walls of this massive fortress are striking. The insides tell stories of those who both lived and died here with only 10 major buildings still remaining out of the original 160. Hue is surrounded by seven royal tombs, all elaborate resting places for the Huynh dynasty, ruling from 1802 to 1945. There are countless tours that visit these tombs, with two of the most popular being Mun Man and Cai Dinh. Mun Man was the second monarch of the Huynh dynasty and was generally a well-liked emperor due to his policies expanding and stabilizing Vietnam.  Covering 15 hectares, it's easy to spend an hour here as the tomb and grounds still stand in great condition. A short drive away is the tomb of Kai Din. This is a much smaller tomb, possibly reflecting that he was largely an unpopular emperor at the time. Reigning during French rule, he was generally perceived as a puppet with little actual power. Khai Dinh was the country's second to last emperor ever, with his successor ultimately abdicating, thus ending the Vietnamese monarchy in 1945. Unlike Hoi An, Hue felt much more lived in by its locals. When we weren't peeking into its history, we were seeking out its hospitality. We rediscovered a Vietnamese coffee that didn't involve a chicken, and stuffed our mouths with some great food whilst  were here. The hotel we were staying in actually had its own spa and as you can see here we enjoyed it thoroughly. These two days flew by and we were already packing for our final domestic flight which would take us to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's most populated and forward-looking city. Especially after the relatively laid-back Hoi An and Hue, Ho Chi Minh City was a bit of a shock to the system. As we had been sinking south, the temperature had been climbing. Now hovering at 30 degrees, this was double what we had in Hanoi. Previously known as Saigon, Ho Chi Minh City was officially renamed after the Vietnamese revolutionary  and politician. One thing we finally did get to witness here in all of its glory is what it really means to cross a road with over 7 million motorbikes in this city alone. So inspired by the locals, we semi-confidently put our lives into the hands of the oncoming traffic. Not deterred, many a road here would be crossed and conquered.  as we strolled further around the city. After getting some high quality drone shots, dusk began to settle on the city, with the neon signs energizing the streets. It was here where the uniqueness of Ho Chi Minh City  really became apparent. Walking into the main promenade that leads up to City Hall was one of the moments in this trip, and where the city truly comes alive. Before arriving in Vietnam, I'd asked our followers if you had any dining suggestions for the trip. In response, we'd been informed of the lovely sounding Secret Garden restaurant. We liked what we'd seen on Google Maps and thought we'd give it a go. Upon arrival, however, to this rather inauspicious entrance, this was either a genuinely secret  Or we were about to die. To everyone's surprise, there was actually a secret garden on the rooftop, and we were sat down near the coffee machine. We were soon served up yet another lovely feast, and again with a bunch of courses falling under £15. Vietnam in general certainly seems like a country that hasn't forgotten its past, but is clearly one that has already moved forward and will continue to do so, especially for what it offers to travellers. I first visited Vietnam in 2009, and even since then I noticed a massive difference in infrastructure and preparation for the future.  it still just might take me a little while to get used to an egg in my coffee.
