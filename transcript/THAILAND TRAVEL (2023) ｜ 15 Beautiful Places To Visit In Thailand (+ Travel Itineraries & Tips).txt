Phoolanka Forest Park is the absolute highlight here, boasting some of the most incredible sunrise views above a beautiful sea mist. Stay at one of the accommodations along Road 1148 for the best views. Phayao is also home to the biggest freshwater lake in Northern Thailand, and has a variety of unique hidden temples. I'm sorry.  Located in southern Thailand, Koh Lanta is a laid-back island that's a hidden paradise of unspoiled beaches, affordable accommodations, and delicious food. Easily accessible by boat from nearby Phuket, Koh Phi Phi, or Ao Nang, Koh Lanta is a great place to add to your itinerary if you're looking to relax. One of the main reasons travelers come here is to dive or snorkel at its nearby islands and reefs such as Koh Hao. But what we enjoyed most was to simply relax and watch the sunset. So if you're visiting Koh Lanta, definitely make sure you come to the west side of the island for sunset. It's super beautiful and there's a lot of cool beach bars or you can just get your own beer and enjoy the setting sun. you  Located about 80 kilometers or 50 miles north of Bangkok, the ancient city of Ayutthaya was Thailand's capital from the 14th to 18th century.

The Samoy Archipelago is located in the Gulf of Thailand, It includes the popular resort island of Koh Samui, the laid-back Koh Phangan, the diving island of Kutao,  and Angtong Marine Park. Enjoying all three main islands is definitely an option, as they all have distinct vibes and attract different types of travelers. Our favorite one was Koh Phangan, as it had some of the most spectacular beaches and scenery, while also attracting a younger crowd. But the marine park is also a must-visit, and we enjoyed it on a day trip from Koh Samui. We have separate full videos about Koh Phangan and Koh Samui on our channel, so definitely check those out if you're heading in that direction. heading back to northern Thailand we have the ancient town of Sukhothai which is home to UNESCO-listed Sukhothai Historical Park. The park contains approximately 193 ruins that date back to the 13th century.  century Sukhothai kingdom. The most impressive temple is Wat Mahatta, which features beautiful stupas, a pillared pavilion, and two large Buddha images. Other ruins you can't miss are Wat Si Sawai, which is the oldest temple in the park, as well as Wat Sa Si, located in the middle of a lake in a great sunset backdrop.

Chiang Rai City is known for its abundance of colorful temples and art, such as the famous White Temple, the Blue Temple, and the eccentric Ban Dao Museum. But venture outside the city and you'll find a natural paradise, filled with cascading waterfalls  beautiful tea plantations, small villages tucked away in the mountains, and impressive caves. Another province we adore is the less-trodden Kanchanaburi, situated to the west of Bangkok. It's a must visit for anyone interested in an authentic Thai experience filled with cultural, natural and historical attractions. From the infamous Death Railway over the River Kwai, to the fascinating temple set amongst stunning scenery or inside a cave, and the picturesque seven-tiered Erawan Falls. We wish we spent even more time in this area, as four days didn't feel like enough for us. Located in the province of Krabi,  in southern Thailand, Raleigh Beach is one of the most beautiful beach destinations in the entire country. It's only accessible by boat due to the towering cliffs that cut it off from the mainland. You can expect white sand beaches, a small village, and tall natural limestone walls being climbed by both beginner and advanced rock climbers. As Raleigh is close to the city of Ao Nang, you can also decide to base yourself there and visit other areas of the province, which we highlight in our full Krabi video.

It's one of the most popular places to visit in the country, thanks to its stunning temples and architecture.  beautiful mountain scenery, friendly locals, and delicious cuisine. Chiang Mai City is home to the best night market we experienced in all of Thailand, running every Sunday evening. But the surrounding nature parks are also a must visit, such as Doi Inthana National Park, which is home to stunning viewpoints, beautiful waterfalls, and the notorious Twin Pagodas. Our favorite place to visit in the province was Elephant Nature Park, which is known for its ethical treatment of these majestic animals. So the baby elephants just had their afternoon snack. It looks like they have some energy they're starting to play. And now, we've made it to our top three of Thailand. Located in the far south near the Malaysian border, you can find the small paradise island of Kulipe.  Celebrated for its white sandy beaches, crystal clear water, and abundant marine life, this is the ultimate beach destination for snorkeling, diving, and relaxing. It's actually so tiny that you can easily walk from one end to the other. Most travelers only visit Kuali Pei on their way to Malaysia, so the island remains a true hidden gem. Khao Sok National Park is located on the mainland of southern Thailand. Consisting of the immense Chow Larn Lake, steep limestone mountains, a lush rainforest, and a wealth of flora and fauna, nature is truly at its best here. In fact, the park is so vast that the best way to explore it is by doing a multi-day excursion on a long-tail boat. We joined a three-day tour of the park and stayed in one of the majestic floating bungalows on the lake. It was one of our most memorable experiences of our entire Thailand trip.  Located in the northwest of Thailand, Mae Hong Son is likely the most beautiful province in the country. Filled with mountain landscapes, cascading waterfalls, and authentic Thai villages, there's an adventure around every corner. The most popular way to explore this region is by driving the Mae Hong Son Loop, a 600 kilometer or 372 mile route that takes at least 4 days to complete.

As we promised at the beginning of our video, we'll now share three things that we learned in Thailand that will help your own trip. First, the best place to eat traditional Thai food is at the street markets, and you can find them in almost any city in the country. We also made use of Google reviews to find good places to eat, since the restaurants tended to vary in quality and price. Secondly, the best way to get around the islands and cities is with a rented vehicle. We usually rented a scooter, as they were the cheapest and easiest way to navigate the narrow roads. By law, an international driving license is required, and you'll be asked to show yours if you get pulled over by the police. Finally, public transportation is also widely used in Thailand, and it's especially easy to get from one major destination to another. In any tourist town, you'll find tour agencies that issue bus, train, and ferry tickets.  you can also reserve tickets online and we use the website 12goasia. If you're going to travel from the north all the way to the south of the country we do recommend to fly as the prices are generally cheap and it saves a lot of time. We also included a few Thailand trip itinerary options on the screen in case you want to use them to guide your own adventure around the country. This was our personal top 15 of Thailand travel destinations. There are a few places we visited that didn't make our top such as Phuket and there are of course other beautiful destinations in the country too.
