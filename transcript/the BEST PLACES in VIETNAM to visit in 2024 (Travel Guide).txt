And so I just wanted to highlight the very best of Vietnam in this video. we're not going to do this in any particular order i'm just going to show you the best places in the country and so get your notepad ready and don't worry too much because the description of the video will have much more information about each place in this video linked below by the way is a 50 page ebook i've finally finished my vietnam travel guide it's got all the best roads to drive if you're looking to do it by motorbike all of the best places to visit if you're just going there on a backpacking or solo trip so yeah check out the ebook check out the discount and  and let's get on with the video and start reeling off the best places in the whole country of Vietnam. So let's start off with a bang. Let's start with the Hai Giang Loop. Up in northern Vietnam, there is a very famous three or four day motorcycle loop through some of the most incredible landscapes on planet Earth. Okay. Oh, traffic jam here. It's terrible, isn't it, guys? Now, don't worry if you're thinking, I don't know how to ride a motorbike. I'm not really a biker you can still do the Ha Giang loop you go to any hostel in Hanoi or up in Ha Giang itself you can organize to do a tour where a Vietnamese local will drive you you can sit on the back and go with the group and of course like me you can just travel the Ha Giang loop on your own time in your own solo way if you do have your own motorbike or transport you can people have asked me you can do this in a car of course you can but the magic and the majesty only reveals itself on a motorbike in my opinion.  you're able to go on much more dangerous but incredibly scenic roads you can get onto the skywalk for example which is a kind of shortcut that's supposed to be for farmers and local people to go on foot but it is wide enough nowadays to go on a small motorbike and honestly the Ha Giang loop was three days of perfection i just couldn't comprehend at some turns just how beautiful the views were looking down 300 400 meters into the valley below from start to finish so much to see so much to do and if it was me I would do the hajang loop three times in a row it was that beautiful next up and not far from hajang is Hanoi the old quarter in particular it's this really rustic unique and beautiful place it's so alive everything is moving and everyone is existing in but it's such a cluster. There's so many people living on top of each other, working on top of each other, businesses squeezed into every  nook and cranny it's so beautiful as well you've got french churches you've got delicious food there's a beautiful lake there's beautiful temples there's so much to see and do within the old quarter of hanoi it's my favorite city in the whole country by far it's just southeast asia personified it's hectic it's colorful it's fragrant it's noisy it's an attack on the senses and i absolutely love him and i recommend you stay at the central backpackers hostel if you're on a backpacking trip at a really nice time there really social and you've got a beer corner where you can go out in the evenings and just let loose and have a few beers and really soak up the warm hospitality of the vietnamese yes mate i love you london yeah i think it's vietnamese custom to change your drink 400 times one more time next up is halong bay the world famous halong bay i'm sure you're planning to  go here on this trip but just in case you're wondering it was absolutely incredible i went on a luxury tour again the information in the description will help you book one of these the further ahead you plan the further ahead you book it the cheaper it will be i ended up paying about 300 for mine it's an absolutely beautiful place and if you're doing it on a luxury tour or a luxury cruise you'll just experience it in the most comfort possible and for sure spend a little bit of your daily budget cut back elsewhere and go on a luxury tour it was yeah one of the best things i ever did wow oh there's a bathtub with a view next up we're going down south to saigon ho chi minh city as it's now known in particular my favorite place in that city was district one this is the modern area this is the place where there's high-end shopping fast cars luxury places to eat and delicious food and it's where the palace is it's where there's the cathedral  it's where the opera house is as well lots of historical buildings there's also like a walking street where there's loads of bars and nightclubs and then I had a few good nights down there I'll tell you that it's just a hustling bustling type of place and you've got skyscrapers and it just feels like a modern city very different to the rest of Vietnam and I really enjoyed it down there and what you can do as well is if you're staying in a hostel or I stayed in this incredible place it was a hostel but my private room had a bathtub and it was really clean one of the best hostels ever stayed in again it's all linked below and from there i organized to go on the chi chiu tunnel system um i think it's called where you go and visit the vietcong underground tunnel systems and that was a really cool day trip and i organized that in saigon as well so yeah you're probably going to be starting or ending your trip in saigon so allocate at least two or three nights to really get to know district one and the surrounding areas of saigon because uh yeah it was one of the the highlights for me. One of the most scenic, most historical and beautiful and obviously extremely  romantic places was hoi an hoi an has these mustard yellow colored buildings and lots of historical temples beautiful unesco world heritage sites and delicious food everywhere you look lots of places to get tailor-made clothing and at night the highlight is the canal system if you are lucky with the weather and it's not raining you will witness not only a beautiful sunset but the whole canal system will transition and the lights and the lanterns will come on and it just creates this beautiful atmosphere all of the tourists will go up and down on the canal boats and it just creates and yeah a beautiful romantic atmosphere park up at the irish pub get yourself a nice drink listen to the live music and just watch the romance unfold hoi an was one of the highlights for sure this is probably the most romantic place i've ever been alone so next up on my list is north west vietnam now that's a big area and i had to  this i think it was the highlight for me to be honest was this trip where i started in sapa and i drove for about three or four days through northwest vietnam down towards nimbin and along this road which took me two or three days we went through different provinces like sonla and maychow and within northwest vietnam there's so much to do there was a cave that i drove my motorbike through which is just wild oh my god this is actually a cave and this is actually the road Wow, going into a cave. It was also the world's longest glass bridge, which was quite pretty. But for me, it was just the atmosphere of being in one of the most beautiful areas and one of the most least traveled areas. You won't see many travelers at all, to be honest, just the odd biker driving around, having a great time. That's where I met the most locals. That's where I had some of the most best experiences. And the highlight for me was I just pulled over on the side of the roads and there was these kids having the time of their life in this watering hole, jumping off this cliff and uh yeah that summed up my time in northwest vietnam it was just  truly spectacular somewhere that most travelers might not go you might not end up going there if you're not on a motorbike and you've got lots of time but consider it because for me it was actually my favorite part in the whole country you guys have the best life a couple of hours South from Hanoi is nimbin this place is gorgeous now it's not the biggest you probably only need two nights there because there's only a couple of things to do there's few temples and pagodas which are beautiful and you should definitely check those out there's also a really unique boat tour you can do where the vietnamese ladies and sometimes gentlemen will row you for about an hour up and down this gorgeous canal system and you go underneath these limestone cliffs and you get to see these beautiful rice paddy fields and it's where they filmed parts of that king kong movie and it was absolutely gorgeous and the highlight in nimbin was the viewpoint you can get up there in the sunset or go up for sunrise climb up takes about  half an hour 20 minutes to get to the top bring some water bring a camera yeah nimbin was not just a highlight for me of vietnam but it was one of the highlights of southeast asia so for sure visit nimbin the drinks ladies the finished work we're the last people leaving and he's just pointed up at the top of the cliff i can see some goats so i'm gonna quickly follow the drone up and say hello good spot last up and not least this place was gorgeous let's talk about fong na now this place is where they claim to have the most adventure i think they call it the adventure capital of vietnam and you can see why there's so much to do there let me tell you some of the highlights for me uh straight away the duck stop was brilliant this is just somewhere where there's a little farmer and he raises ducks and you can go there and feed the ducks and have fun with the ducks it's absolutely hilarious and one of the highlights of the whole trip in vietnam you've also got some caves that you can do on your own or on a little tour with your hostel check out the the Paradise Cave. Huge, beautiful, absolutely mind-blowing. It does  take an hour of walking to get there but incredible place and then there's also the dark cave now i lost most of my footage from there unfortunately because my gopro got nicked um but you can zip line up and down jump in the river swim down the river and then obviously you go inside the cave and um after about 10 minutes of squeezing through these rocks you get into this big dark area where you can have a mud bath and it's so much fun and so those two caves you can do really easily um rent a motorbike or go on a little tour with your hostel or hotel but if your budget allows check out oxalis they're based in fong na and they do the tours within the larger cave systems including the largest cave in the world and tours start from around 300 all the way up to 3 000 plus depending on what tour you want how many days but have a look at them they do one day two day ones for me i did a three day caving experience in toulan and it was absolutely gorgeous one of the best  experiences physically demanding of course but super rewarding we've got some incredible photographs and I got to make some friends for life doing it so for me fong na is the Adventure Capital somewhere not to be missed and even if you've not into caves the surrounding areas are just beautiful fong na was special all right then thank you for checking out this short informational video if you're new to the I do longer form content normally.
