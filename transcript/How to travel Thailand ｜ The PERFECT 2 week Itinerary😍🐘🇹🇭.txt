 Thailand, the land of smiles, elephants, limestone cliffs, world-famous beaches, delectable food and astonishing temples. We're going to take you all over the country and show you what to do, where to stay and how to have the best time possible. If you're planning a trip to Thailand or have always wondered what it's like here, then this video is for you. Welcome to the perfect two-week trip through Thailand. I love you, bye. I look to the left to see where you are. I love you, bye. We think the perfect starting point for your trip is going to be Bangkok. But if you prefer, you can tweak things and start in Phuket. It's completely up to you. If you choose Bangkok, you're likely to land in Suvarnabhumi International Airport.  airport. There is another airport called Don Myung which you will use for your domestic flights around Thailand so just be aware of that. From the airport we ordered a grab to our accommodation which took around 45 minutes. You can take the train if you want to avoid the insane traffic. The train usually takes around 25 minutes to get into the city center but it can be a bit of a pain if you have a lot of bags. Accommodation especially Airbnb can be a bit tricky in Thailand. Technically, short-term stays of less than one month are not allowed, so we recommend you book either a hotel or a hostel in the areas listed here. The best areas for tourists are Siem Square, by far the most happening and best location for shopping. Sukhumvit is Bangkok's longest and most famous street, which is lined with bars, restaurants, shopping centres and all. Khao San is good for a party scene and has lots of backpacker options. And then there's Bangkok Old Town which is popular for its close location to many of the historical sites. Sulong gets an honourable mention on the list  a financial district during the day which comes alive with rooftop bars, sidewalk stalls and street vendors during the night. And make sure your hotel is within walking distance of a 7-eleven and the BTS. We have a bunch of accommodation options listed in our Thailand resource pack available on our website. Welcome to Bangkok, the first stop on our Thailand trip. This bustling, crazy city has a couple of iconic things for you to dabble in. Temple hopping, insane markets and shopping, some crazy street food and an insane nightlife. Alright, it's day one of your trip. let's take you through how to have the perfect first day in Thailand. After breakfast at either your hotel or my personal favorite, whenever we're in Thailand 7-11, you're going to want to head to Old Town to take in some of the world famous temples.  starting at the location of the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kao, home to the Emerald Buddha and regarded as the most sacred Buddhist temple in Thailand. Don't forget to cover up with long pants or grab a pair of these trusty Thai Ellie pants, available everywhere in Thailand. This entire compound honestly is like a botanical garden, you could walk around here for hours. There are temples and shrines and buildings and just so much to look at and it's so beautiful guys, it's so worth coming here. I definitely see why it's the most popular spot in Bangkok. Exploring Bangkok is always more fun with some friends. Today we're here with Lloyd and Mandy who are also coffee creators. And they just got back from the States from doing RVing, which we would love to do one day guys. That's so cool. They actually offered for us to use their It could all be one day. But yeah, we're just gonna have some fun, get in shape.  This is definitely one of the things you have to do in Bangkok. Tuk-tuk rides, man. We'll be doing lots of them throughout our time in Bangkok. They're so much fun. I even saw a Hello Kitty theme one the other day. Hopefully we can find one and go on one of those too. It's so cute. Our next stop is Wat Pho Temple just down the road from Grand Palace. You can walk or grab a tuk-tuk. Wat Pho is famous for two things. It houses the largest collection of Buddhist images in Thailand and the very main reason you're coming. Welcome to the Wat Pho Reclining Buddha. It's absolutely massive, honestly. Look at it. Wow. And it's completely covered in gold flakes. How insane is that? And honestly, this entire building that it's in is so impressive. There's beautiful murals and paintings in gold on the walls. Honestly, so beautiful. The temple is considered the earliest centre for public education and houses a school of  known as a birthplace of traditional Thai massage which is still taught and practiced to this day. Yes you can book and get a massage at the original Thai massage school. Do it! After a bit of sightseeing it's time for lunch and of course you're going to try and find a Pad Thai. We went to Thip Samai for probably the most touristy Pad Thai experience you'll get but it was awesome to see exactly how the dish is made, have fast and efficient service and a delicious meal. After lunch take some chill time and get ready for... The next thing that you need to do when you're here in Bangkok on your very first day, we always recommend that you either do a food tour or a city tour. This tuk tuk tour is basically both. We're going to be touring around Bangkok in the cutest little tuk tuk, trying food, looking at temples and learning about history. I think it's a fantastic introductory tour. First stop was to try some sweet and every street food snacks that were to die for. We also had the chance to try insects for the first time. You just  have to give them a try. That's like a salty chip. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We then visited a beautiful white temple and learned about the fascinating history of Thailand. The tour was absolutely jam-packed. Our highlights were visiting one of the biggest and brightest flower markets and getting gifted flowers by our amazing guide, Maya. And then the last stop of the tour. Yay, we made it to Chinatown. This is definitely a highlight here in Bangkok. It's one of the top spots you have to visit and honestly it kind of reminds me of Times Square. It's like Thailand's version of Times Square. It's so cool. Very Chinese, so of course all the signs are in Chinese. Lots of street food, lots of buying, lots of shopping here. It's awesome. For day two, we suggest taking it a little easier because day one was pretty eventful. You can start your morning off with a leisurely stroll through Lumpini Park. Be sure to look out for the monitor lizards. Then head over to Jim Thompson Music  museum for a guided tour of the home and to learn all about the Thai silk industry. After the museum, either take a short walk or you can opt to use a river taxi which we loved using in Bangkok, down one of the canals to the next stop. The next thing you have to do when you're here in Bangkok is to come to a mall and I know there's going to be people in the comments saying how on earth can you go to a foreign country and just go to malls. Guys, the malls here are tourist attractions themselves. insane and if you love shopping as much as me you are going to thrive here there are massive malls there's so many we are here today at central world central world it's busy it's bustling there's so many tourists and we're about to go shopping in the malls there are so many nice nice restaurants there's michelin star restaurants there's restaurants that have lines outside of them and this is one of them. There were so many people outside  and I was like what is going on here we have to obviously eat there and it turns out there's boat noodles here and that's like the most popular dish to eat here in Bangkok. Boat noodles are basically famous in Bangkok because of all the canals and people selling food from the boats that's why they're called boat noodles. I got the beef one, Red got the chicken one and then of course we got some Thai cheese as well. Number one this is a very popular dish you should eat in Bangkok and number to you can come to the mall and eat it i know there's a couple of people that are too scared to eat street food that's why the mall is actually a really good alternative because you can have the authentic meal here and not worry about it being funny anyway i'm starving let's eat after the mall we've got a few options for you catch sunset on a rooftop bar we did the eagle's nest in bangkok old town which overlooked the beautiful wat arun temple it was a spectacular sight you You could head to one of Bangkok's many night markets, job fairs as a  popular one not too far from the Siam Paragon Mall area. Home to over 700 different stalls, it's a great place to head for some dinner and drinks. Then, if you're interested in this kind of thing, go watch a Muay Thai match at the famous Rajadamnone Stadium. Muay Thai is Thailand's national sport. It's badass and intense, so be warned. Then, if you're the partying type or just want to check out the nightlife, take a stroll down the famous Khao San Road. Bangkok's craziest street. Here you can eat scorpions because when in Bangkok do some shopping and grab dinner and drinks with friends. Also you can get your marijuana fix here as well because if you didn't know it's recently been fully legalized here in Thailand. So far you've pretty much ticked off all the best spots so day three is definitely optional. If you really want to get touristy then we recommend a couple of experiences  available on Get Your Guide. First one is going to be a day tour to the famous floating market and railway market. It is a bit outside of the city so you can expect a one and a half hour drive to get to the market itself. Don't worry, most tours on Get Your Guide include pickup and drop-off options. If you're up for more on this day then either head to one of the sky bars we've listed on the screen now or do one of the activities you might not have done the day before. All right, on day four, we're heading up north to Chiang Mai. You can get there either by plane, train, or bus. The choice is yours. The flight is a little over an hour, and the train or bus options are around 11 hours each. We opted to fly. Next up on our itinerary is the beautiful Chiang Mai, and you're pretty much coming to Chiang Mai for three things. First is a truly bucket list worthy item, and something that you must do when you come to Thailand, and that is visit an elephant sanctuary. Number two, you're going to visit all the beautiful temples in Chiang Mai. And number three,  you're here for the food because it's next level. We suggest visiting Chiang Mai for two to three nights. We've actually been here for a whole month because besides it being a really good tourist destination, it's also an incredible digital nomad spot and has some of the best wifi. Actually, no, it has the best wifi we've ever experienced. And the condos and cafes are amazing here. Your first day and night in Chiang Mai will look similar to this. First of all, you're gonna go to one of the amazing cafes they have here. They have so many. Our personal favorite is Oasis Cafe because it truly is an oasis. It's under trees and it's got koi fish and it's got beautiful working areas. It's great. Then after Breki, you're going to go temple hopping. There's so many temples in Chiang Mai. The three most popular temples in Chiang Mai, first of all, is Wat Phra Sing. It is the most visited temple and that's because it's home to one of the most important Buddha images, the Lion Buddha.  The second temple is Wat Chiang Man and that is the oldest temple in Chiang Mai. It was built in 1296 by the king who discovered Chiang Mai. And third is Wat Chebi Luang. It is the second most popular temple here in Chiang Mai and it was built in 1441. At the time it was the highest structure during the Lan Na Kingdom now known as Northern Thailand. And you can actually book a full temple tour through Get Your Guide to see and learn about all of them with a local guide at your side. We'll go ahead and link that for you down below. We decided to visit this temple because of the elephants on the side. It's so cute. I love the look of it online. It just goes with the whole Chiang Mai elephant theme, you know? I love it. After all that temple hopping, It's time to experience the best Asian food of our lives.  and that is here at this restaurant called Khao Soi Niman. And of course, we're here to eat Khao Soi. We've actually eaten this already and when Rick tried this dish for the first time, he said, quote, this is the best Asian dish I've ever eaten. I'm not joking, guys. This really is my favorite dish in Asia. Claire even asked me, even after India? And I said, absolutely. This is number one in my heart. So, we're back here again to eat this. You guys guys guys guys guys guys guys guys guys guys and they're one of the few ethical  places in Thailand that look after these beautiful animals like oh I'm beaming honestly it's important for us and of course you to pick an ethical place where you're spending your money so I'll actually link an article down below and there's a whole list of all the ethical ones in this one scratching his thumb by the way oh sorry for the interaction sorry for the interruption there guys I have a feeling this is going to be a highlight of our trip here in Thailand and for you of course too. Chai Lai isn't just a sanctuary they also have bungalows all over the property giving you the chance to quite literally live amongst these wonderful creatures. We also got to take the ellies on a walk around the forest. Come girl let's go are you ready? Let's walk. Mape? Mape ma? It means come? Okay, how are we now? We're going to the bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb!  make and feed them some tamimuti and of course give them a bath in the river. Overall it was an incredibly fulfilling day. If you stayed over at Chai Lai then on day six you'll wake up and be greeted first thing in the morning with room service by the elephants themselves. You can then relax a bit before saying one last goodbye to the ellies. It's about a two-hour drive back to Chiang Mai. If you're up to it when you're back you can go visit one last temple. Head up the mountain to Wat Phra Tat Toi Su Tet, one of the most visited in Chiang Mai offering beautiful views of the whole city down below. Since we're up in the north, we just had to come here to Chiang Rai.  to some of the most beautiful temples in the whole of Thailand. It's an easy bus ride from Chiang Mai, it's about four hours and it's about $11 each. Alternatively you can take a driver or a taxi, it'll be shorter but obviously a little bit more expensive. We arrived this afternoon at our highly rated hostel, picked up a cute little scooter for 250 baht and our first stop is here at the Blue Temple. There's one temple in Thailand that I have been dying to see for years now, and that is the White Temple. This is the Blue Temple, and it was actually created by the students of the artist who created the White Temple. And if this is a sign of what the White Temple is going to look like, oh my word, we are so excited. This is truly stunning. The details, the colors, oh, it's so beautiful.  music the ambience everything's so good it is free entrance to tourists even so you can just make donations inside if you want yeah just wonderful what a great way to start Chiang Rai we are up bright and early this morning to finally see Thailand's most visited temple and probably the most beautiful temple in the whole world welcome to White Temple  This right here is worth coming to Chiang Rai for. It is so beautiful and as I said before, I've been waiting years to see this temple. It lived up to every expectation. It's so worth coming. Please come and do it. Only 100 baht entrance. Amazing. I mean, just look at it. Just look at it. Yeah, it's insane. After Watt Temple, it's time to head back to Chiang Mai by bus to board our flight down to Phuket. It's coming to the end of your Thailand holiday and obviously you want to spend the time on the beach, on the islands, just soaking up the sun and all those island vibes. So you have basically two options. You've got Krabi, Phuket, Maya Bay and Phi Phi all in the southwestern part of Thailand, Or you can  head to the exclusive kind of islands of Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao on the south eastern part of Thailand. This behind me is Phuket and we're currently on Kata Noi beach. Phuket is basically famous for its beaches and it's insane nightlife and there's a couple of other things you can do as well. It's definitely the most popular of the two options and that is mainly because of the bigger international airport which offers direct flights in and out from most cities around the world so it's a perfect place to end your trip you can fly home directly from here. As well as the fact that Maya Bay is on its doorstep, one of the most beautiful and picturesque places you can visit in the world. On your first day in Phuket we recommend obviously doing some beaching. There are so many beaches along the western coast. Some of them are Natong Beach, Banana Beach, Freedom Beach, Karon Noi, Yanoi and Kata Noi, all of which will be linked in our resource pack. After the beach head up the mountain to see the Big Buddha, one of the most popular spots here  Phuket. From there you can end your day taking a stroll down one of the most famous or should we say infamous streets in the whole world, Bangla Road. Here you'll find bars and nightclubs, places to smoke shisha, do some drinking, watch a ping pong show and a whole lot more. On day 10 we're going to get up early and head to Kron viewpoint for views of almost the entire island after that head to the very cute and colorful old town to seek out piquette's two favorite dishes their noodle dish called hoi kin mee or mark wayne's personal favorite roti and curry we've listed a number of restaurants in our resource pack for you something definitely worth coming and doing here in piquette is piquette old town it's incredibly cute it's so colorful every single building is a different color and this area holds so much history as well It was actually built up in the 1800s during the period when Paquette was mining tin. There was lots of riches here.  lots of foreigners and immigrants coming here as well so they built these little cute as houses and now it's a tourist attraction you can do lots of shopping and eating and exploring here it's so cute after old town it's time to head to rosada port which is just 10 minutes away to board a ferry bound to the islands. We're off to Koh Phi Phi. You can book at the port itself or make a booking on Get Your Guide which is a little bit easier. The last ferry for the day usually leaves the port at around 3 pm and it takes about two hours to get to Phi Phi. Once on the island we suggest you take a stroll around Phi Phi town or definitely head to the viewpoint for sunset. It's so beautiful. Then for dinner eat chicken khao pad served in a pineapple. It's a pretty iconic Thai dish. For dessert you could try one of these fried ice creams, they're really good  and then there'll be countless fire shows on the beach you can check out too. Hell, even get a bamboo tattoo which is a pretty iconic thing to do here if that's your jam. On day 11 we're going to take a long tail boat tour to Maya Bay, the most famous beach in Thailand. This is the real reason you're here in Phuket. You'll get some time to spend on the beach and you'll get to see other sites such as Monkey Beach, Viking Cave and even do some snorkeling. We've linked a bunch of boat tours available on Get Your Guide but you can also book on the island itself. We're up bright and early to head back to Paquette mainland and honestly it's time to start mellowing out. It's been a busy holiday. Our favorite place to do that is definitely Khao Sok National Park, specifically at Elephant Hill.  This was 100% a highlight of our trip. If you book a stay with Elephant Heels, they'll fetch you at Rosada Port and take you all the way to Khao Sok themselves. We did a whole video of the experience, you can watch it here. That was so lovely. I feel emotional. Two hours we were with these ellies for, just feeding them, touching them, watching them. Oh my gosh, the sights we saw today and the sounds we heard with these elephants are so unique. Never ever seen or heard some of the things we just experienced. That was so beautiful. Look at these old ones behind me. Don't you think they're the cutest? After meeting the ellies, you'll get to float down a river with your own guide, eat wonderful food back at camp, and most importantly, relax in absolute bliss. The The sounds of nature here are next level.  For the last day of your trip, you're going to head to Chau Lan Lake. whole day eating and relaxing, sleep in a water bungalow and really just mellow out. If you want you can go on a little kayak around the lake or join for a forest walk and have the chance to spot some of the rare gibbons that live in the area. Welcome to Khao Sok National Park. This is Thailand's hidden gem. Not a lot of tourists come here and it is a must do if you love nature. so  Love that. That was so good. After lunch, Elephant Hills will shuttle you back to Phuket or anywhere else you want to go. They even offer to take it all the way over to Koh Samui. It's the last day. Do some beaching or shopping or just relax at the pool. But that's it. Your time in Thailand has come to an end and honestly you will go home with the most fond memories like we did. You can fly home directly from Phuket International Airport or via Bangkok.
