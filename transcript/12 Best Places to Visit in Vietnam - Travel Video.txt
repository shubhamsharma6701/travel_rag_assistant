Phu Quoc is a scenic island in the Gulf of Thailand. While it officially forms part of Vietnam, it is actually closer geographically to Cambodia. Today, it's characterized by dense tropical jungle, soft sandy beaches, and undulating hills.

The reunification palace is also a fascinating place to go. a famous spot in Vietnam's history as it captures the time when Saigon fell as a tank broke through the gates of the palace.
