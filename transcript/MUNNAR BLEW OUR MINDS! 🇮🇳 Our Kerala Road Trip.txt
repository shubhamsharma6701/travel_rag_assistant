 Kerala has been on our travel bucket list for years and now we finally made it to this magical state in India. We are starting our road trip in Munnar, a breathtaking hill station. On our first days of our road trip, we visited the beautiful Irawikulam National Park, went on a crazy hike to the Chokramundi Peak and we found many hidden gems surrounded by tea plantations. Munnar truly blew our minds. Let's start our road trip in Kerala and as you can see we start with delicious local Kerala food we get it on a banana leaf and yeah super exciting good start of the road trip but you have to eat with hands Mira yeah no I asked for a spoon oh oh really good is This is spicy? You have to try it Not spicy?  This one is spicy, this one is spicy, this one is spicy, this one is sweet also, this is pineapple curry So nothing spicy? Yeah Oh okay, oh there's pumpkin, I've not seen pumpkin Sweet little chutney in this one Big tooth, this is ginger, this is lemon pickle, then this one mango pickle Mango, that smells really nice My phone feels like home It's really nice I found my favorite dish it's the pineapple curry and I think their pineapples are super fresh because when we were driving up here there are so many pineapples next to the road and the best so good now we're ready for dessert and what was the name of this? I think Seway but in Kevlar there would be some other name we think this is Seway and it's there's noodles in there Yeah, it's nice. What are you for?  oh ready to go on the road to munnar because that was the end destination for today we have discovered first time slow motion in iphone yeah it's really cool like you never saw a lot of us like this we are here we are at our destination in munnar it's not really in munnar it's a bit further away from menard there are a lot of hotels here but our hotel it's really quiet there's almost nothing around and there's jungle it's literally in the middle i'm really curious about our room it's up there so it's even better welcome to wild poetry and here in the entrance you bump into a couch which the color is really cool the same for this one and if you come a bit further there is a bed and this is where you why we choose to stay in the field.  are amazing and we have a balcony. I'm sure we'll enjoy our coffee there. And it's super private because all you see is jungles. And we can watch ants. And it is super high, right? It is super high. Oh, really? It is also dogs. No, that's birds. Monkeys. maybe monkeys yeah look at this guys that is our room right there and we are here as we were surrounded by the beautiful nature we couldn't resist going for a walk and exploring the area we enjoyed some delicious food and called it a day I'm going to make a  This cannot get any better. So pretty, so beautiful and now the sun is coming out. What else can we ask for? On our first adventure in Munnar, we decided to visit the most famous national park in the area, the Irawikulam National Park. So we also have to pay for the camera everywhere. We were blown away by the beauty of Kerala. However, other tourists found something else fascinating. Hello, hello.  famous here but i feel the least famous person here what yeah you're the video but the views oh it's so pretty and i just didn't know india had these beautiful views so i think this is barely just one it's just the beginning there's just so much to explore in the park you'll see many Nilgiri Thars a kind of a goat they are endangered but the park gives them a safe place to live. Don't sit in the back. The problem with the viewpoints who are located on the map is that there are many people stopping there so it kind of destroys the whole beauty. Now we are just driving and we're just stopping on pretty spots and this is one of them. I want to show you something. look at these flowers everywhere you drive everywhere we go we see this beautiful pink  orange purple flowers it's really amazing we came back to our hotel because this place is just so magical and we also decided not to really rush on this trip normally we are really like we want to make the best of every day we go to there there on the way and this trip we want to just just take it relax and really enjoy the beauty and if we have a stay like this just really enjoy the stay and i think we can just sit here for a one two hours and look at the views and enjoy this beautiful view and then tomorrow we will do something really cool really active as well so take a little rest today we have an extremely beautiful adventure plan so we are going to chokramundi peak that is one of the highest peaks in this area and the coolest part about that peak is that you don't need any sort of guide you don't need any permission so it's open 24 hours you can just go by yourself  But apparently we do need a guide because he's saying that you need a guide and he's coming with us. I think it's a bit unclear everything. I'm making breakfast. The plan was to eat this on top of the mountain but we'll tell you later what happens. The plans are changed again. We were at a starting point which is mentioned almost everywhere on the internet for this hike. And then we arrived there and it was like huh is this a starting point? It doesn't feel like a starting point at all. and luckily there was a guy next to the road he was selling coffee and we asked him and surprisingly his english was perfect and what turned out he was actually the guide for that hike but he said to us like six years back or so i was starting from this point but now not we are starting from this other point or that's the starting point what are you doing doing some go parking and Addy's getting super excited there's roads here or there are  tricky you know it is this mountain roads with the indian crazy traffic perfect combination for daredevils we made it or i think we made it because the sign is up there chukka mundi welcomes you and i must be honest i don't understand how people park here there are now three cars parked and it's kind of full so maybe there's not many people doing this yeah we'll see i'm really curious when we come back if it's packed but yeah let's go we just paid the entrance tickets and we choose this hike because you didn't need a guide but apparently we do need a guy because he's saying that you need a guide and he's coming with us i think it's a bit unclear everything that's why we need a guy yeah if it's if it's raining no go is impossible the trek is a little bit tricky so if someone is a beginner  having a guide is really handy. You see it goes super steep here. Right Mira? And we have to go somewhere really far. So it's just three hours straight up. So we'll let you know in the end how good we are fitness wise. This hike is steep, really steep. I know you don't really see that on the video, but it is, believe me. Wear good shoes. Like that. Like these. So  I think if we would have come by ourselves we would be lost for sure. We are going through these jungles. It's like really thick forest. Almost feels like we're walking in rainforest. But it is this point of a mountain. There are also a lot of dangerous trees here. That one. If I look at them I already get goosebumps. We found the skin from a porcupine. I don't know what a porcupine is, but maybe Addy shows you now a picture on the screen. Time for some grapes. Oh, this is for you and this is for me. But hiking is one of our favorite things. Not one of, it's the favorite thing. Nothing makes us more happy than a good challenging  hike and yeah i think this hike is also really perfect even if you're a beginner and if you have a guide i think it's a good test for you to see that how do you go with hiking because it's just one and a half hour and we're on the top yeah like for beginners like we we have done quite quite a bit of hiking we are not professionals but we can call ourselves maybe intermediate so like we have been through all different terrains and stuff but yeah you need fitness and it's amazing the fields you go through the jungle oh i love it the tea gardens it almost looks like the windows wallpaper remember yeah windows 98 i have to actually know it's amazing it's really pretty some sites they almost look like switzerland yeah i'm not gonna lie it is just beautiful so if you want to avoid crowds in munnar because the tourist places they get insane packed because they are just so so so accessible this hike is for you because also  you don't do in a group you know you do with the guides and really cheap yeah for just a guy yeah we made it we were all the way down we didn't feel much going down because it is really tricky and yeah a lot of danger to slip do you see that mountain in my back that is where we went and we did it within three hours we left at 8 36 and we're here now at 11 23. so proud and we on the top we took a break for like 20 minutes we took many breaks to film but we made it like a little shot Come on.  Oh it's more. Oh this is really good. Very sweet. This is what we needed. It's actually insane good. Look at this guys. This is the best thing ever guys. We found a place to have some lunch and I think we are getting a lot of North Indian food. Probably it will take really long to be prepared. And we are on our way to Surianelli, but we didn't book an accommodation yet. So we have to go on an accommodation hunt and hope that we find a place with a really nice view. warm but it smells delicious let's try the butter chica  Paneer tikka masala You can always get a hint of a miss if it's a miss Oh it's pretty good So how was the lunch Mira? Oh I'm on fire My lips are burning, it feels like numb you know How more Addy enjoys how more suffering it is for me But it was delicious, that's the stupid thing, you taste all the delicious food but it's just so spicy So we have found accommodation, yay! And a dog So now we have to park our car somewhere else and Adi is really... Is it good for the tires or what? So many crazy adventures with this car We ended up in a dorm and I think it's a really pretty hostel We were looking for some accommodations here, but there were really  roots kind of to us and none of them really look nice and I think this one is really pretty it's a bit out of the city you have this beautiful view around and we'll show you later the cars. These are a nice dorm. Yeah, that's nice. We are really pushing our limits because we really love our privacy when we are traveling so we like to prefer a private room doesn't matter how cheap it is it just has to have a bed and something to store our bags. I think Mira is going to show her talent. Dick had gone here.  She's strong! You got something? So this is tea, you can have tea. I think you get it in Zen mode at one point. Yeah. I'm a strong woman now. I cut for 30 seconds and I already feel it in my shoulders. in my shoulders no joke so i'm sure all these women they have super strong arms but it is really satisfying because you really see what you have to cut and it's like cutting grass i think the school kids here are the luckiest school kids because they have this beautiful nature and the beautiful views Thank you for watching our first days in Munnar.
