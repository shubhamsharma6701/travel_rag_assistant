 Hey it's Phoebe and today I'm in Kerala! Alright so this is my first time visiting India and I have absolutely no idea what to expect. I'm going to be exploring Kerala which is located in southern India on the tropical Malabar coast and it's a place known as God's own country and I am so excited to visit some beautiful places and try a whole lot of authentic local food. But first to get there, I flew from Singapore to Trivandrum, which is the capital city of Kerala with Scoot. Now, I knew I needed an e-visa, so I had applied and been approved for one. But what I didn't know is that it needs to be printed. So when I tried to check in for my flight, I couldn't. And I had to pay $4 to print it at this place at Chennai Airport. So make sure if you're flying to India, you have a visa and you have it printed. There's a link below for you to where I applied for my visa because you do need to look out for scams. Now, it should only cost you around  10 US dollars you apply online and there are no express options. So you need to apply well in advance The flight took four hours. So it was nice and fast and when I landed they checked my printed visa again I collected my bag and headed straight to the hotel now. I spent the night at the Grand Hyatt Trivandrum it is brand new and the rooms are super modern They're luxurious and very very comfortable. If you need a place to stay in Trivandrum, this one is perfect I absolutely love to here and I would stay here again This morning we've made our way here to Ayman Arm It's a tiny village tucked away on the outskirts of Qatayim city about four hours drive north of Trivandrum Now we boarded these boats and set off along the gorgeous backwaters and on this adventure I'm actually traveling with around 30 content creators from all over the world as part of the Kerala blog Express which is hosted  to buy Carol and tourism so you can expect to see a whole lot of new faces in this episode let's go I'm already on my way, on my way Well, you blushing, yeah, sweet concussion Oh, you miss my touching, you do Show me something, give me more than one thing I need more than nothing, I do Say you're a good guy, baby, believe it Don't wanna hear it, I wanna see it See if I can love  Rewind, we rewind It feels so nice, I can't help it Let's get sweeter, I'm already on my way I'm calling up, don't be late I'm calling through all the days, there ain't sweet times You need to say this to me, money but no flowers, babe I'm already on my way, on my way We've been dancing all night long You might be with you way too long Don't want nothing here alone But I'm down waiting Down, down waiting Sweet talk, I'm already on my way I'm pulling up, don't be late I'm cutting through all the lanes Sweet talk, you need to say this to me I'm even up there I'm already on my way, on my  All right, so we are doing something really, really cool. We are about to spend the night on these amazing luxury houseboats. And the thing about this trip is that we have roommates. And I was lucky enough to get a really amazing roommate. This is Jo. Hi, everyone. There's a good chance you actually recognize Jo. Jo is like a legit entertainment professional. And Jo and I have been put together and we showed up to the boat and we didn't know what was going to happen but it's um... Yeah, we're here in a bed, we've got a jacuzzi, it's all go. We've got a private tour on our way here. And look at our little romantic dinner set up! It's you and me babes.  Come from a wandering baby Are you made up or for real? Say can you feel what I feel? Cause I can't tell if I'm just dreaming I wish I had a guy like you And I wish you could be real But you're not really here I don't wanna wake up without you But tonight is gonna have to do If I'm gonna get with a girl like you I fade away Every day you're not with me Now that you've shown me what love could be like What can I say? I know it sounds like I'm crazy This is being awesome. This has been a really, a really great start to this.  I don't know what I expected coming to India. I think I thought it would be busier, a lot more people. I was a little nervous and overwhelmed. It was a brand new city for me and from the second I arrived, everyone's been so lovely. Everyone's been so welcoming. They're so happy to have you here. So happy to see you trying the local food and experiencing the culture and just being part of the community, really. everyone has been amazing if you are unsure if you have any doubts come to Kerala start here it is it is the perfect gateway honestly I am having the best time and this houseboat experience is something else this is really really special the crew are all amazing the houseboat is so lovely I love that it's a little rustic but you're going around through these just gorgeous backwaters with palm trees lining each side and little kids are running around saying hello, other boats are coming past and  Everyone's just so happy to be here. It's such a good energy. This is awesome. This is a really great first taste of India. I come alive at night I like lace and I like braids But I love my netthro Edges laid from the east side Building on the best cause My high dollar mess with paint don't clean I'ma take your shit All them fake followers, they don't like your pics I rep the water bearer sign But all the elements flavoring free in my mind Yeah.  Good morning you guys and good morning to you. Good morning. Bye. Alright so we are waking up on the boat this morning and interestingly we didn't cruise all night. We did our cruise yesterday evening. After the sunset we went back to the dock. We spent the night there and now we are up and we are out and we are about again. So we are going to cruise for about an hour this morning, have some breakfast and just enjoy the morning magic. Now what I love about this is that you get to see all the locals going about their business and everyone is just so happy and so nice and so welcoming. It is such a lovely way to start the day and we have some pretty fun things planned for today. So I hope you're ready for a really fun one.  Second chances, empty-handed I wonder, would you love me better if I could come back home? I wonder, can we trust the stars are quick to let us go and go? You know we got this life, no guarantees and stars And I'm fine, I'll go back some day And try to keep them for my mind I didn't buy myself  No guarantees you'll find me Said if it's faith you'll find me Leaving the past behind We're in places Going off to different places Different planets But you're all up past me By this imbalance What if we run out of time And second chances Empty handed Oh no Would you love me better if I go? I'm not home I wanna know Can we trust this dust About to let us know How to grow Joe's choking in the background. Don't choke on the vlog. Alright. It is time for lunch. And we have come to Decadie. Now it took about four hours on the bus to drive from where we were in Albuja to right here. And we're in a place called Greenwoods. Which is a really beautiful hotel resort kind of thing. You know, the buffet, the lunchbox.  buffet let me tell you I was walking up that thing filming it and my stomach was doing somersaults it smells amazing I know this is a little obvious but if you love Indian food you're gonna be in heaven and southern Indian food to me is my favorite type of Indian cuisine I went hard out on the buffet you guys I did not hold back I've got a plate just stuff full of everything let's just dig in and give everything a try now I have to tell you so far the naan breads everywhere have been nothing short of exceptional so I'm expecting this to be a good one too okay you go to Japan you get the best sushi in the world right you come here to Kerala you get the best naan in the world it is so so good that's what we get to try okay so I got some malai kofta like a potato bowl kind of thing. I don't know if it looks good. Oh, that's really good. This one is like a masala or  some kinds with like chickpeas and like tomato based sauce the truth is it's all good there isn't a weak link in the chain and the last thing I want to try for you is something I didn't order but they brought out for me I can't remember the name of this if you know what this is called just comment it for me apparently it's like a specialty they cooked it on the spot it's like some kind of a bread it's very white very kind of squishy rubbery and they brought it out with its own special curry and they said this is what you have to have it with i don't know what that is but we're gonna eat it i just want it's not meat it's really good the bread tastes different to a naan it's kind of like a there's more of like a fermented taste to it absolutely delicious to be my lawyer  I love you what you want to be, my love, my love My little baby, come rise with me My little baby, come ride with me Maria, Maria, Maria Every time you're lookin' out for me Every time you're lookin' out for me Love you, ah, yeah, love Everything go from Maria, yeah 10,000,000, ah, yeah, yeah Every time we meet up, every time we lay our body out I'm a party, yeah She's from Kilimanjaro  Alright, this afternoon we are doing something really exciting.
