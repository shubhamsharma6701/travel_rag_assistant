 Rishikesh. I've heard a lot about this place in the past few years. It's one of the most popular spiritual places in India and for sure it's famous worldwide to be the capital of yoga. I really really enjoy Rishikesh. After one month of pure chaos in Delhi, Agra, Rajasthan, Varanasi, I finally found a place that allowed me to relax, deeply connect with nature and recharge. To be honest after one month of traveling with my motorbike I'm a little bit exhausted and Rishikesh is just the perfect place to recharge. The air quality is great and most importantly the weather being very near the Himalayas it's very fresh and very pleasant. I stayed in Rishikesh for five days and to be honest I couldn't easily stay longer so in this video I will bring you with me during these days and I will show you around. We are going to witness a very special RT in the evening We're going to meet people, shopping around.  eat food and explore this beautiful city in India. So sit back, relax and enjoy this video. Good morning guys, it's 6.20 in the morning in Rishikesh. It's a bit windy. And I want to witness the sunset by the Ganga River. And just contemplate life and relax by this holy river. Nyeshe Keshe.

So this is my room here in Rishikesh. Very simple. I'm paying 1500 rupees per night. And I really enjoy being here because I have a lot of conversation with Shiva. Which is always sitting outside. His room is there. So every day we have a great chat. Here is Shiva.  I'm here with my friend Shiva. He's the owner of this guest house, which is called? Hotel Lashman Grand in Lashman Gula. Very good location. Near the Ganga. Yeah, so we have a program for the yoga and some other things and we are giving that just like a tip for Uttarakhand. So Shiva not only is the manager of this guest house, but he's also a yoga teacher palm reading. about the Ayurvedic therapies. Ayurvedic therapy. And then he can organize some nice package around Uttarakhand and then he can bring you to some hidden places. I'll put his contact down below if you want to contact. If you come to Rishikesh and you want to organize something, then get in touch with Shiva. Thank you, bro. you  Man, I'm really enjoying Rishikesh. There is such a great vibe and atmosphere. It's really, really nice. And the temperature, it's perfect, man. In the morning and in the evening, it's quite cold. But then during the day, it's like perfect temperature. It's like a springtime and the sun is shining. It's beautiful. So what is this? Diamond manufacturing company. Sri Ramakrishna Export SRK. It's a company. It's a member of the company.

Now I'm a proper Indian tourist. all right guys it's 5 30 p.m almost sunset time and i'm heading to parmart niketan ashram which is the most popular place in rishikesh for the arty during the sunset but as you can see man this bridge is super super crowded and very scary man there are just too many people and while walking everything is shaking  under my feet. So every day at sunset time there is this wonderful celebration and worship that is called Arthi where so many people come and I heard it's a beautiful thing to experience and to witness. So what is the Arthi? Arati is basically a word derived from the Sanskrit word Aratrika, which means something that removes ratri, which means darkness. So the original terms basically means that this ceremony will remove darkness from life. And it's a Hindu ritual and ceremony in which light, usually from a flame, is offered to one or more deities. And then there are songs, chanting. It's a very special moment of prayer, of worship, of celebration. Such a special moment.  Shreya Yagyatiya, Daya Shreya Jatiya, Ramgit Maa Sutta, Ramgit Maa Sutta. so this is my third day in rishikesh now and i really dig it to be honest the vibe and the atmosphere is very relaxed a lot of people into yoga in the mountains perfect temperature it's It's a great place to unwind, relax,  recharge the battery after the crazy rajasthan tour i really dig it actually let me know in the comments below if you have ever been to rishikesh for me i wanted to come for many years and i'm really happy to be here and i will definitely come back again because it's really nice rishikesh actually is considered the mecca of yoga and here there are like 400 yoga schools so you can literally do yoga everywhere here and many people come here to study to become like a yoga teacher so there is this ttc program which is the teacher training course which usually lasts like one months two months three months it depends on the quality of the course and you really dive deeper into yoga and you learn how to become a yoga teacher that's also why there are many foreigners here and here in rishikesh also this rafting is very popular as a sport activity so many people do it there are so many excursion tours it looks pretty fun all right guys shiva is recommending me a hidden gem 20 kilometers north of rishikesh and i'm gonna go there okay I'm sorry.  so shiva and the owner of my guest house recommend me this place because it's a little bit outside of Rishikesh. I'm like 25 kilometers north of Rishikesh. It's a small secret hidden spiritual place. There is also a cave which has a lot of spiritual history. Yeah and he recommended me to come here and just spend some time to relax, contemplate life, meditate a little bit. So I decided to come and here I am. We are still on the Ganga river which looks incredible and man the road here was so much fun. I really had a great time. Now I really understand why so many people in the comments told me like Gabi go to the Himalayas  with a motorbike now i'm getting closer to the himalayas i don't think i would go there we'll see but now i can really understand because the roads they become really fun in the mountains the temperature is great the curves are fun the twists so now i get it i really enjoy this area so in the coming days i might explore a little bit more north of rishikesh because there is so much to see you sorry oh my god this is amazing there is sand here and the ganga without construction just raw nature and the ganga river what a place man it's like a beach you know look at this it's like a ganga beach man i'm in love with this area it's so beautiful  The cave is so beautiful. It's not possible to film inside, so I cannot show you anything, but it's completely dark, and there were some people meditating inside. And before, there was a monk living inside, a sage. such a strong spiritual energy. It's amazing, it's really amazing. I'm sorry.  The world is full of the divine. The world is full of the divine.

The world is full of the divine. words are not enough to explain so my feelings he understood I am very happy you have to be careful for everything whatever is coming to you you have to recognize because everything and everybody and every part of the nature is filled with so many tricks so you have to understand what is good for you if there is something good for you calling you come and take it if something not good for you you have to recognize what it is good because If I am saying that the sequence is always spiritual,  divine and kindful and pure then this is good but always not because the planet the timing the period of the time is changing so the a lot of people from different different places starting moving into the recipients now you will won't find the purity suitcase as it was before but i believe that if you believe on yourself yourself will guide you to the right person this is the soul connection and whatever is happening it's being designed we are playing down we are not skipped we didn't write the script the script writer producer and director is on the top who is with every movement watching us and helping us with the nature so so much love from me thank you very much for your kindness and divine sir your kindness thank you working and behaving good for others this is your good prayer to the god  I always see this one around and I always wanted to try it's a potato and they fry it it's actually pretty good this was my last evening in Rishikesh so I just walk around enjoy the markets because in the evening there are so many markets in Rishikesh and then the day after I decided to check out a town nearby which is called Haridwar I didn't know about this town but actually Shiva told me that it's a very popular and very special place so I decided to go and check it out I just stumbled upon this beautiful town which is called Haridwar. It's just 27 kilometers south of Ritchikesh and I just discovered that it's a  very famous pilgrimage place very religious place for hindu people and it kind of looks similar to rishikesh has like the ganga river in the middle and some nice bridges around so many people around so many people just bought him because of the holy water of the ganga it's very fascinating and super busy To be honest, the poverty and amount of beggars here, it's a little bit overwhelming. So many people on the street just begging for food and it's pretty extreme.  All right guys, now I'm going to end this video here. I have to be honest, I didn't plan to stop here in Haridwar. And even though I stopped just for 20 minutes, 30 minutes, this place kind of shocked me. The amount of poverty and the amount of like really poor people, beggars. And I don't know, I just felt a lot of pain, a lot of misery. And it kind of shook me a little bit. It's hard to be here  hard to witness all of this as i said it's a very religious place many people come here to bath into the ganga and to do the puja and a lot of ceremonies they also have art in the evening but uh yeah just a quick stop really touched me to be honest and that's all for this video guys thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoy rishikesh through my eyes and through my emotions and stay tuned because in the next video i decided to go to the himalayas for a couple of days so I will bring you with me and we're going to explore together some amazing places so stay tuned for the next video thank you again for watching and I'll see you in the next one bye
